# FROMTON
Make your cheese like a chef!

For our license validation, we need to create a mobile application with a consistent Business Plan. So I decided to create Fromton, a cheese recognition app that allows you to easily accompany the consumer before or after buying their cheese. 

## Installation

Use the command [npm install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) to install Fromton.

```bash
npm install
```
Use the command [pod install]() in Ios folder for Ios dependencies.

```bash
pod install
```
